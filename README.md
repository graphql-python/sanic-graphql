Sanic-GraphQL
=============

Adds [GraphQL] support to your [Sanic] application.

Based on [flask-graphql] by [Syrus Akbary].

Usage
-----

Just use the `GraphQLView` view from `sanic_graphql`

```python
from sanic_graphql import GraphQLView

app.add_route(GraphQLView.as_view(schema=Schema, graphiql=True), '/graphql')

# Optional, for adding batch query support (used in Apollo-Client)
app.add_route(GraphQLView.as_view(schema=Schema, batch=True), '/graphql/batch')
```

This will add `/graphql` endpoint to your app.

### Sharing eventloop with Sanic

In order to pass Sanic’s eventloop to GraphQL’s `AsyncioExecutor`, use `before_start` listener:

```python
@app.listener('before_server_start')
def init_graphql(app, loop):
    app.add_route(GraphQLView.as_view(schema=Schema, executor=AsyncioExecutor(loop=loop)), '/graphql')
```

### Supported options

-   `schema`: The `GraphQLSchema` object that you want the view to execute when it gets a valid request.
-   `context`: A value to pass as the `context` to the `graphql()` function. By default is set to `dict` with request object at key `request`.
-   `root_value`: The `root_value` you want to provide to `executor.execute`.
-   `pretty`: Whether or not you want the response to be pretty printed JSON.
-   `executor`: The `Executor` that you want to use to execute queries. If an `AsyncioExecutor` instance is provided, performs queries asynchronously within executor’s loop.
-   `graphiql`: If `True`, may present [GraphiQL] when loaded directly from a browser (a useful tool for debugging and exploration).
-   `graphiql_template`: Inject a Jinja template string to customize GraphiQL.
-   `jinja_env`: Sets jinja environment to be used to process GraphiQL template. If Jinja’s async mode is enabled (by `enable_async=True`), uses 
`Template.render_async` instead of `Template.render`. If environment is not set, fallbacks to simple regex-based renderer.
-   `batch`: Set the GraphQL view as batch (for using in [Apollo-Client] or [ReactRelayNetworkLayer])
-   `cors`: If `True`, set basic CORS headers in response to CORS preflight requests, otherwise - don't set any CORS headers (It's recommended to use [Sanic-CORS] extension).

You can also subclass `GraphQLView` and overwrite `get_root_value(self, request)` to have a dynamic root value per request.

```python
class UserRootValue(GraphQLView):
    def get_root_value(self, request):
        return request.user
```
